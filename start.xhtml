<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>When this site grows up, it wants to be a character generator for Shadowrun, 4th edition; if you're interested, the database backend is called <a href="freecode.com/projects/sr4sql">sr4.sql</a>. Right now, it's still a construction site (and this page is a bit of a placeholder); feel free to test it, but do not expect it to be complete or bug-free. If you do play around with it and find a bug, I'd appreciate if you reported it to <a href="mailto:nadja@ef.gy">nadja at ef dot gy</a>.</p>
<p>Go ahead and play around with it, anyway - <a href="http://sr4.ef.gy/createcharacter">create a new character</a>!</p>
